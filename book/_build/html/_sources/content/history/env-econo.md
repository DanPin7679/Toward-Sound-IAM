# Environmental Economics

Environmental Economics is strongly rooted in Neo-Classical theory and models and rely heavily on externalities and the common tools to manage them.

## Proto-Economics

Early economists wrote mostly about agriculture, farm management, and crop prices

- That's what the economy was about then

They were keenly aware of the importance of the natural environment

Typically thought that the human condition was primarily shaped by climate and geography

### Aristotle

"[t]hose who live in a cold climate and in Europe are full of spirit, but wanting in intelligence and skill [...] and are incapable of ruling over others [..] [w]hereas the natives of Asia are intelligent and inventive, but they are wanting in spirit, and therefore they are always in a state of subjection and slavery."

### Condorcet (1776)

agricultural activity by corrupting the air, causes illnesses in neighbouring homes

### Physiocrats

even made land the anchor point in their theory of value

## Classical Economics

Classical economists were convinced that, in the long run, resource constraints would stop economic expansion

No more growth

If the population would continue to grow, economic output per capita would shrink

Current degrowth movement argues for economic shrink to save the environment, a moral duty rather than a resource necessity

### Adam Smith

- Invisible hand of general equilibrium
- Social good by individual action
- Nightwatch state

Except for ... ehecting and maintaining certain publick works and certain public institutions ... because the profit would never repay the expence to any individual, ... though it may frequently do much more than repay it to a great society

### Thomas Malthus

growing population, diminishing returns to scale in agriculture

### David Ricardo

agreed with Malthus, but distinguished between diminishing returns to scale (intensivel margin), diminishing quality (extensive margin)
Like all Classical economists, Ricardo believed that economic growth would end

### John Stuart Mill (1857)

agreed with Malthus and Ricardo, but tempered with innovation and input substitution
Amenity value "it is only in backward countries of the world that increased production is still an important object[ive]"

"There is room in world, no doubt, for a great increase in population, supposing the arts of life to go on improving, and capital to increase.
[...] The density of population necessary to obtain all of the adwantages both of cooperation and of social intercourse ...] has been attained. A population may be too crowded, though all be amply supplied with food and raiment. ...] Nor is there much satisfaction in contemplating the world with nothing left to the spontaneous activity of nature."

### WS Jevons (1865)

"I must point out the painful fact that such a rate of growth will before long render our consumption of coal comparable with the total supply. In the increasing depth and difficulty of coal mining we shall meet that vague, but inevitable boundary that will stop our progress."

## Neo-Classical Economics

Value is relative, determined in exchange, reflecting preferences, production costs and scarcity

- Earlier theories of value were absolute, prices set by God, land, or labour
  Demand and supply, partial and general equilibrium
  Absolute scarcity no longer seen as a problem, a reflection of the times
- Push into Africa, India, Siberia, American
  West
- Rapid technological progress
- Rapid industrialization

It cut the link with environment and until latly, most Neo-Classical Economists was still thinking like that.

### Hotelling (1931)

worked on the economics of exhaustible resources

- Largely ignored until the 19705

### Marshall

Externalities - if there are unintended and uncompensated consequences of one agent to the next, then market transactions need not be Pareto improving

Marshall (and Paley) also worked on overexploitation of common property

### Pigou / Bator

Taxes can counteract this

Core of environmental and resource economics goes back to the early days, but was never prominent

### Modern Neo-Classical Economics

Early growth models: no resource limits

## Keynesian Economics

### Keynes

Keynes' macro-economics indirectly reinvoked interest in economic growth

## Environmental & Resource Economics

In the 196os and 70s, things changed: Limits to Growth, Silent Spring, oil crisis, pollution, space travel, congestion

Environmental economics is the dominant (orthodox) school of thought, in the tradition of Pigou and Simon

- Environmental problems can be corrected at the margin
- New economics (post Dixit-Stiglitz) has had little impact on environmental economics
- Causal inference has only recently made inroads

{ref}`histo:ecolo-econo` is a heterodox school of thought, in the tradition of Malthus and Boulding

- Environmental problems require systemic change

### Rachel Carson

Silent Spring

### Kenneth Boulding

Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or
an economist

### Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen

economics gives no signs of acknowledging the role of natural resources in the economic process... the product of the economic process is waste, waste is an inevitable result of that process and ceteris paribus increases in greater proportion than the intensity of economic activity
Models of the economy as a part of the natural environment
