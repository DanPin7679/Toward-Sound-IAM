# The difference between Eological and Environment Economics

Environmental Economics did not emerge as the result of a new shift in economic thinking, but rather formed around a reorientation of standard neoclassical assumptions. This was undertaken in an effort to address environmental issues emerging several decades back. In contrast, it shall be argued that the field of Ecological Economics has brought to the Economics Discipline an appreciation for novel assumptions and a distinct methodology that differs fundamentally from Neoclassical Economics and, in fact, challenges many of the neoclassical assumptions that form the foundation for Environmental Economics

The use of externalities to conceptualize environmental issues clearly demonstrates how environmental economists have adopted neoclassical methods and related assumptions.
