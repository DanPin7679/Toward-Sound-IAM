## Solow Model

The modern study of economic growth starts in the post-war period and was mostly motivated by the experience of the developed world. In his classical article (Kaldor 1957), Nicolas Kaldor stated some basic facts that he observed economic growth seemed to satisfy, at least in those countries. These came to be known as the Kaldor facts, and the main challenge of growth theory as initially constituted was to account simultaneously for all these facts. But, what were these Kaldor facts? Here they are:2

1. Output per worker shows continuous growth, with no tendency to fall.
2. Thecapital/outputratioisnearlyconstant.(Butwhatiscapital?)
3. Capitalperworkershowscontinuousgrowth(...followsfromtheothertwo).
4. The rate of return on capital is nearly constant (real interest rates are flat).
5. Labour and capital receive constant shares of total income.
6. Thegrowthrateofoutputperworkerdifferssubstantiallyacrosscountries(andovertime,wecan

As it turns out Robert Solow established a simple model (Solow 1956) that became the first work- ing model of economic growth.3 Solow’s contribution became the foundation of the NGM, and the backbone of modern growth theory, as it seemed to fit the Kaldor facts. Any study of growth must start with this model, reviewing what it explains – and, just as crucially, what it fails to explain

Alternatively, if we introduce exogenous technological change that increases productivity, we can generate long-run growth in income per capita, but we do not really explain it. In fact, any differences in long-term growth rates come from exogenous differences in the rate of technological change – we are not explaining those differences, we are just assuming them! As a result, nothing within the model tells you what policy can do about growth in the long run

There are clear lessons about: (i) convergence – the model predicts conditional convergence; (ii) dynamic inefficiency – it is possible to save too much in this model; and (iii) long-run differences in income – they seem to have a lot to do with differences in productivity.

## Ramsey model

As it turns out, British philosopher and mathematician Frank Ramsey, in one of the two seminal contributions he provided to economics before dying at the age of 26, solved this problem in 1928 (Ramsey (1928)).1 The trouble is, he was so ahead of his time that economists would only catch up in the 1960s, when David Cass and Tjalling Koopmans independently revived Ramsey’s contribution.2 (That is why this model is often referred to either as the Ramsey model or the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model.)
