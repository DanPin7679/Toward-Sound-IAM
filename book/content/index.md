# Introduction

This book is a review of the theories and related models that leads to today's Integrated Assessment Models "IAM". In each section, we start we a high level historical review of the theory followed by a description of the major elements on which this theory is build on.We focus mostly on parts that are essential to understand the models that we will study.

Then we analyse the relevant models going through the following step:

- Description of the model
- A Schematic representation
- The Mathematical representation
- Ordinary Differential Equations Representation
- Python Implementation
- Model Analysis

### Description of the model

### A Schematic representation

### The Mathematical representation
